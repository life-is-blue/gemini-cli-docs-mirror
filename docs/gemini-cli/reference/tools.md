# Tools reference

Gemini CLI uses tools to interact with your local environment, access
information, and perform actions on your behalf. These tools extend the model's
capabilities beyond text generation, letting it read files, execute commands,
and search the web.

## How to use Gemini CLI's tools

Tools are generally invoked automatically by Gemini CLI when it needs to perform
an action. However, you can also trigger specific tools manually using shorthand
syntax.

### Automatic execution and security

When the model wants to use a tool, Gemini CLI evaluates the request against its
security policies.

- **User confirmation:** You must manually approve tools that modify files or
  execute shell commands (mutators). The CLI shows you a diff or the exact
  command before you confirm.
- **Sandboxing:** You can run tool executions in secure, containerized
  environments to isolate changes from your host system. For more details, see
  the [Sandboxing](/docs/cli/sandbox) guide.
- **Trusted folders:** You can configure which directories allow the model to
  use system tools. For more details, see the
  [Trusted folders](/docs/cli/trusted-folders) guide.

Review confirmation prompts carefully before allowing a tool to execute.

### How to use manually-triggered tools

You can directly trigger key tools using special syntax in your prompt:

- **[File access](/docs/tools/file-system#read_many_files) (`@`):** Use the `@`
  symbol followed by a file or directory path to include its content in your
  prompt. This triggers the `read_many_files` tool.
- **[Shell commands](/docs/tools/shell) (`!`):** Use the `!` symbol followed by
  a system command to execute it directly. This triggers the `run_shell_command`
  tool.

## How to manage tools

Using built-in commands, you can inspect available tools and configure how they
behave.

### Tool discovery

Use the `/tools` command to see what tools are currently active in your session.

- **`/tools`**: Lists all registered tools with their display names.
- **`/tools desc`**: Lists all tools with their full descriptions.

This is especially useful for verifying that
[MCP servers](/docs/tools/mcp-server) or custom tools are loaded correctly.

### Tool configuration

You can enable, disable, or configure specific tools in your settings. For
example, you can set a specific pager for shell commands or configure the
browser used for web searches. See the [Settings](/docs/cli/settings) guide for
details.

## Available tools

The following sections list all available tools, categorized by their primary
function. For detailed parameter information, see the linked documentation for
each tool.

## Under the hood

For developers, the tool system is designed to be extensible and robust. The
`ToolRegistry` class manages all available tools.

You can extend Gemini CLI with custom tools by configuring
`tools.discoveryCommand` in your settings or by connecting to MCP servers.

### Regenerating model responses

Some integration tests use faked out model responses, which may need to be
regenerated from time to time as the implementations change.

To regenerate these golden files, set the REGENERATE_MODEL_GOLDENS environment
variable to "true" when running the tests, for example:

**WARNING**: If running locally you should review these updated responses for
any information about yourself or your system that gemini may have included in
these responses.

```bash
REGENERATE_MODEL_GOLDENS="true" npm run test:e2e
```

**WARNING**: Make sure you run **await rig.cleanup()** at the end of your test,
else the golden files will not be updated.

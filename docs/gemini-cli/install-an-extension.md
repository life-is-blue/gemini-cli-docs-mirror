### Install an extension

Install an extension by providing its GitHub repository URL or a local file
path.

Gemini CLI creates a copy of the extension during installation. You must run
`gemini extensions update` to pull changes from the source. To install from
GitHub, you must have `git` installed on your machine.

```bash
gemini extensions install <source> [--ref <ref>] [--auto-update] [--pre-release] [--consent] [--skip-settings]
```

- `<source>`: The GitHub URL or local path of the extension.
- `--ref`: The git ref (branch, tag, or commit) to install.
- `--auto-update`: Enable automatic updates for this extension.
- `--pre-release`: Enable installation of pre-release versions.
- `--consent`: Acknowledge security risks and skip the confirmation prompt.
- `--skip-settings`: Skip the configuration on install process.

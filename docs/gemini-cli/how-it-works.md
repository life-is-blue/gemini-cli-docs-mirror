## How it Works

1.  **Discovery**: At the start of a session, Gemini CLI scans the discovery
    tiers and injects the name and description of all enabled skills into the
    system prompt.
2.  **Activation**: When Gemini identifies a task matching a skill's
    description, it calls the `activate_skill` tool.
3.  **Consent**: You will see a confirmation prompt in the UI detailing the
    skill's name, purpose, and the directory path it will gain access to.
4.  **Injection**: Upon your approval:
    - The `SKILL.md` body and folder structure is added to the conversation
      history.
    - The skill's directory is added to the agent's allowed file paths, granting
      it permission to read any bundled assets.
5.  **Execution**: The model proceeds with the specialized expertise active. It
    is instructed to prioritize the skill's procedural guidance within reason.

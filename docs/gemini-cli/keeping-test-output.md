### Keeping test output

You can preserve the temporary files created during a test run for inspection.
This is useful for debugging issues with file system operations.

To keep the test output set the `KEEP_OUTPUT` environment variable to `true`.

```bash
KEEP_OUTPUT=true npm run test:integration:sandbox:none
```

When output is kept, the test runner will print the path to the unique directory
for the test run.

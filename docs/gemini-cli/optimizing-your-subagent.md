### Optimizing your subagent

The main agent's system prompt encourages it to use an expert subagent when one
is available. It decides whether an agent is a relevant expert based on the
agent's description. You can improve the reliability with which an agent is used
by updating the description to more clearly indicate:

- Its area of expertise.
- When it should be used.
- Some example scenarios.

For example, the following subagent description should be called fairly
consistently for Git operations.

> Git expert agent which should be used for all local and remote git operations.
> For example:
>
> - Making commits
> - Searching for regressions with bisect
> - Interacting with source control and issues providers such as GitHub.

If you need to further tune your subagent, you can do so by selecting the model
to optimize for with `/model` and then asking the model why it does not think
that your subagent was called with a specific prompt and the given description.

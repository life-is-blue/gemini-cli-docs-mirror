### Decisions

There are three possible decisions a rule can enforce:

- `allow`: The tool call is executed automatically without user interaction.
- `deny`: The tool call is blocked and is not executed. For global rules (those
  without an `argsPattern`), tools that are denied are **completely excluded
  from the model's memory**. This means the model will not even see the tool as
  an option, which is more secure and saves context window space.
- `ask_user`: The user is prompted to approve or deny the tool call. (In
  non-interactive mode, this is treated as `deny`.)

> [!NOTE]
> The `deny` decision is the recommended way to exclude tools. The
> legacy `tools.exclude` setting in `settings.json` is deprecated in favor of
> policy rules with a `deny` decision.

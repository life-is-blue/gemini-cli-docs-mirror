# Preview release: v0.64.0-preview.0

Released: October 6, 2026

Our preview release includes the latest, new, and experimental features. This
release may not be as stable as our [latest weekly release](/docs/changelogs/latest).

To install the preview release:

```
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli@preview
```

## Highlights

- **Atomic File Operations & State Recovery**: Serialized file tool operations
  with atomic writes and introduced atomic CLI state persistence with automatic
  recovery from backup on corruption.
- **Chat Recording Optimization**: Implemented append-only delta patching and
  bounded history windowing in ChatRecordingService to optimize memory and disk
  efficiency during long-running sessions.
- **CLI Input & Reference Resolution**: Added support for resolving `@file:line`
  references, resolved CPU hangs and quote swallowing on `@` symbols within code
  blocks, and prevented ghost text wrap hangs.
- **Terminal UI & Interaction Stability**: Ensured Ctrl+C emergency aborts reach
  active cancellation handlers, made selection list confirmation with Enter and
  Spacebar reliable, and fixed Windows ConPTY IME cursor forwarding.

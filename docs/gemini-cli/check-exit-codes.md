### Check exit codes

Gemini CLI uses exit codes for high-level flow control:

- **Exit 0 (Success)**: The hook ran successfully. The CLI parses `stdout` for
  JSON decisions.
- **Exit 2 (System Block)**: A critical block occurred. `stderr` is used as the
  reason.
  - For **Agent/Model** events, this aborts the turn.
  - For **Tool** events, this blocks the tool but allows the agent to continue.
  - For **AfterAgent**, this triggers an automatic retry turn.

> **TIP**
>
> **Blocking vs. Stopping**: Use `decision: "deny"` (or Exit Code 2) to block a
> **specific action**. Use `{"continue": false}` in your JSON output to **kill
> the entire agent loop** immediately.

## Directory structure

The integration tests create a unique directory for each test run inside the
`.integration-tests` directory. Within this directory, a subdirectory is created
for each test file, and within that, a subdirectory is created for each
individual test case.

This structure makes it easy to locate the artifacts for a specific test run,
file, or case.

```
.integration-tests/
└── <run-id>/
    └── <test-file-name>.test.js/
        └── <test-case-name>/
            ├── output.log
            └── ...other test artifacts...
```

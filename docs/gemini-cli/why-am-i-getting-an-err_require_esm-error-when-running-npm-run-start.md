### Why am I getting an `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` error when running `npm run start`?

This error typically occurs in Node.js projects when there is a mismatch between
CommonJS and ES Modules.

This is often due to a misconfiguration in your `package.json` or
`tsconfig.json`. Ensure that:

1.  Your `package.json` has `"type": "module"`.
2.  Your `tsconfig.json` has `"module": "NodeNext"` or a compatible setting in
    the `compilerOptions`.

If the problem persists, try deleting your `node_modules` directory and
`package-lock.json` file, and then run `npm install` again.

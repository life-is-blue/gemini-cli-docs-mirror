### Run from source (recommended for Gemini CLI contributors)

Contributors to the project will want to run the CLI directly from the source
code.

- **Development mode:** This method provides hot-reloading and is useful for
  active development.
  ```bash
  # From the root of the repository
  npm run start
  ```
- **Production-like mode (linked package):** This method simulates a global
  installation by linking your local package. It's useful for testing a local
  build in a production workflow.

  ```bash
  # Link the local cli package to your global node_modules
  npm link packages/cli

  # Now you can run your local version using the `gemini` command
  gemini
  ```

### Listing servers (`gemini mcp list`)

To view all MCP servers currently configured, use the `list` command. It
displays each server's name, configuration details, and connection status. This
command has no flags.

**Command:**

```bash
gemini mcp list
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!NOTE]
> For security, `stdio` MCP servers (those using the
> `command` property) are only tested and displayed as "Connected" if the
> current folder is trusted. If the folder is untrusted, they will show as
> "Disconnected". Use `gemini trust` to trust the current folder.

**Example output:**

```sh
✓ stdio-server: command: python3 server.py (stdio) - Connected
✓ http-server: https://api.example.com/mcp (http) - Connected
✗ sse-server: https://api.example.com/sse (sse) - Disconnected
```

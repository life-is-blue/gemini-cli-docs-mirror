## Troubleshooting

- Error: `missing system prompt file '…'`
  - Ensure the referenced path exists and is readable.
  - For `GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD=1|true`, create `./.gemini/system.md` in your project.
- Override not taking effect
  - Confirm the variable is loaded (use `.gemini/.env` or export in your shell).
  - Paths are resolved from the current working directory; try an absolute path.
- Restore defaults
  - Unset `GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD` or set it to `0`/`false`.

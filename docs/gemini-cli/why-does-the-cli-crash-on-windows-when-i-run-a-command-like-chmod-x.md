### Why does the CLI crash on Windows when I run a command like `chmod +x`?

Commands like `chmod` are specific to Unix-like operating systems (Linux,
macOS). They are not available on Windows by default.

To resolve this, you can:

- **Use Windows-equivalent commands:** Instead of `chmod`, you can use `icacls`
  to modify file permissions on Windows.
- **Use a compatibility layer:** Tools like Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for
  Linux (WSL) provide a Unix-like environment on Windows where these commands
  will work.
